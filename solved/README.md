### Problem-12

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first
ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

> **1** : 1  
>  **3** : 1,3  
>  **6** : 1,2,3,6  
>  **10** : 1,2,5,10  
>  **15** : 1,3,5,15  
>  **21** : 1,3,7,21  
>  **28** : 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?

---

First interesting Problem :D

Using the combinatorial number of the powers of all primfactors of N,
compared to simply divding triangle numbers in a loop made the solution
in .2 secounds.

Using primfactors you only have a divide loop till sqrt(n) instead of n/2 or n/4 divisions
for the simple loop, giving you a speedup for the solution of more then 2000.

### Problem-14

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (n is even)  
n → 3n \+ 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains
10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought
that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

Using recursiv colatz function with long long int,
checking if n is even and n/2<the current biggest gave speedup by factor ~2

### Problem-15

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to
the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

![](project/images/p015.gif)

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

---

Did this riddle some years ago in school, really like it ;)

There is only one possibility for the sides so, first row and col are all = 1
the rest is the sum of the possibilities above and left from the gridpoint
the resulting number over the grid form the triangle of pascal :)

### Problem-99

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more
difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt) (right click and
'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with
a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the
greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example
given above.
