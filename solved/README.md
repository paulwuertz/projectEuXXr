(###Problem-1)


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Just a loop and a contition, boring...


(###Problem-2)




Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



(###Problem-3)



The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


(###Problem-4)



A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.



(###Problem-5)


2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1
to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the
numbers from 1 to 20?


(###Problem-99)

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more
difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt) (right click and
'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with
a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the
greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example
given above.
