### Problem-1


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Problem-2




Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Problem-3



The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

Uses some recursive function and a global var.
The number gets broken down recursivly, when it is dividible by some number
and the new bound get calculated by the sqrt of the result. Tests divisor and result
for being a prime and updates the global var BIGGEST accordingly.

### Problem-4



A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

### Problem-5


2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1
to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the
numbers from 1 to 20?

Makes a doubly linked list of two numbers primfactors,
then compares each of the factors and takes the maximum of each
to calc their smallest common multiple c.

The c and the next number are processed till 20 is reached.

### Problem-6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 \+ 22 \+ ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Problem-9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 \+ b2 = c2

For example, 32 \+ 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a \+ b \+ c = 1000.  
Find the product abc.

### Problem-10

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

### Problem-99

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806 would be much more
difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt) (right click and
'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with
a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the
greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example
given above.
