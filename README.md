# Project EuXXr

My solutions for project E. Don't tell anyone ;) And try to solve it yourself though ;)

### Make'n'Run

`make all` makes all project files
`[0-9]` or make `[0-9].c` makes the specific project number i.e. `make 3` or `make 3.c` will make project 3

### Get all puzzles

'''bash
pip install html2text beautifulsoup4
python getPuzzle 1 620
'''

Be carful, it will override all your files in the unsolved folder!!!
